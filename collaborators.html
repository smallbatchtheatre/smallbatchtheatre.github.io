    <h4>Leah Englund Brick – Artistic Director</h4>
    <p>
      I am a theatre artist. I fill different roles in different projects - director, actor, teacher, choreographer, designer - but I am always interested in the whole world of the play. I sculpt intimate and overlooked moments for the stage. Drawing from the visual arts, literature, nature and music, I collaboratively create theatrical collages that expose ways I experience the world. When something piques my interest, I investigate why this thing matters to me. I dig in. I research its history, its connections with culture and society, science and math, and any other fields that it touches. I look for my own associations. I discuss these things with my collaborators. We rehearse so that we can organize, synthesize, and physicalize materials we have found. When this process uncovers something beautiful, human, and truthful, we share it with our audience.
