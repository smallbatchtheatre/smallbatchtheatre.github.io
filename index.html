                Small batch bakeries, breweries, and distilleries make the very best goods in each of their crafts.  They choose only the freshest ingredients, and keep the scale down so they can achieve the highest quality.  They develop new recipes, and push their craft in new directions.  Small Batch Theatre company brings that dedication, concern for quality, and quest for innovation to its plays.  We select plays with a sense of poetry.  We bring together teams of artists and value each artist's ideas and opinions on every part of the play.   Small Batch Theatre Company develops truthful, vulnerable, and human moments.  We strive to find new ways of seeing the beauty in everyday experience. Small Batch Theatre Company is based in Baltimore, Maryland.  We collaborate with local theatre artists, technicians, writers, and anyone else who has great ideas.
